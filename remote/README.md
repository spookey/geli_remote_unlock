# Remote

This folder contains scripts to be installed on the machine which serves the
keys and/or passphrases.

It is possible to deploy keys and passphrases onto different machines.

## Setup

Deploy the contents of this folder to your remote server, and copy the
`config.sample.sh` to `config.sh`

Adjust the settings according to your needs.

## Remarks

Per default, the *provider* script searches for keys and passphrases in the
subfolders `keys` & `pass` respectively.

This is not really encouraged. Please store those confidential files
somewhere safe and adjust the paths in the *config*.
